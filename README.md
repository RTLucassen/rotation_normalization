## Contents
The repository contains two folders:
- `dataset_curation` contains all python files that were used for annotation and preprocessing of the dataset.
- `models` contains all python files that were used for training and evaluation of the different rotation angle prediction approaches.
  - Parameters for the rotation angle prediction models trained as part of this project are available from the corresponding [HuggingFace repository](https://huggingface.co/RTLucassen/orientation_normalization).
